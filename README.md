# Mixtape Mania (Global Game Jam 2018)

This was a game made in Unity for the [2018 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/mixtape-mania). It's a 2D platformer brawler, with a gamemode that is a mix of CTF and KOTH.

## Description
World Radio 104.5 has requested a mixtape from two bands, but can only play one. You and your bandmate must go record the music in your favourite bar by bringing the tape and jamming out. You have to work together to fight off other band and keep the tape recorder at your favourite hangout! Can your band be the one to transmit your favourite music to the world?
